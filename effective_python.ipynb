    "## Item \\#2: PEP 8\n",
    "* PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal\n",
    "* Continuations of long expressions onto additional lines should be indented by four extra spaces from their normal indentation level.\n",
    "• Functions, variables, and attributes should be in lowercase_underscore format.\n",
    "* Protected instance attributes should be in `_leading_underscore` format.\n",
    "* Private instance attributes should be in `__double_leading_underscore` format.\n",
    "* Classes and exceptions should be in `CapitalizedWord` format.\n",
    "* Module-level constants should be in `ALL_CAPS` format.\n",
    "* Always use absolute names for modules when importing them, not names relative to the current module’s own path. For example, to import the `foo` module from the `bar` package, you should do `from bar import foo`, not just `import foo`.\n",
    "* If you must do relative imports, use the explicit syntax `from . import foo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Item \\#3: Know the Differences between `bytes, str,` and `unicode`.\n",
    "For Python 3:\n",
    "* `bytes` contain raw 8-bit values\n",
    "* `str` contain Unicode characters\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python 2:\n",
    "* `str` contain raw 8-bit values\n",
    "* `unicode` contain Unicode characters\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to represent Unicode characters as binary data (raw 8-bit values). The most common encoding is UTF-8. \n",
    "* `str` instances in Python 3 and `unicode` instances in Python 2 do not have an associated binary encoding. \n",
    "    * To convert Unicode characters to binary data, you must use the `encode` method. \n",
    "    * To convert binary data to Unicode characters, you must use the `decode` method. \n",
    "* When you’re writing Python programs, it’s important to do encoding and decoding of Unicode at the furthest boundary of your interfaces. The core of your program should use Unicode character types (str in Python 3, unicode in Python 2) and should not assume anything about character encodings. This approach allows you to be very accepting of alternative text encodings (such as Latin-1, Shift JIS, and Big5) while being strict about your output text encoding (ideally, UTF-8).\n",

    "### Helper Functions for conversion in Python 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def to_str(bytes_or_str):\n",
    "    if isinstance(bytes_or_str, bytes):\n",
    "        value = bytes_or_str.decode('utf-8')\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        value = bytes_or_str\n",
    "    return value  # Instance of str\n",

    "        value = unicode_or_str.decode('utf-8')\n",

    "    return value  # Instance of str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 2 and 3 GOTCHAS!\n",
    "* In python 2, unicode and str instances seem to be the same type when a str only contains 7-bit ASCII characters. This behavior is not dublicated in python 3 in regards to instances of bytes and strings, so you should be deliberate about the types of character sequences that you're passing around.\n",
    "* In Python 3, operations involving file handles (returned by the open built-in function) default to UTF-8 encoding. In Python 2, file operations default to binary encoding. This causes surprising failures, especially for programmers accustomed to Python 2. For example, say you want to write some random binary data to a file. In Python 2, this works. In Python 3, this breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('/tmp/random.bin', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    f.write(os.urandom(10))\n",
    " >>>\n",
    "TypeError: must be str, not bytes\n",
    "```\n",
    "The way to remedy this is to be specific of the data that is being opened in write binary mode ('`wb`') instead of write character mode ('`w`'). This problem also exists for reading data from files. The solution is the same: Indicate binary mode by using '`rb`' instead of '`r`' when opening a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Item \\#4 Write Helper Functions Instead of Complex Expressions\n",
    "* Python’s syntax makes it all too easy to write single-line expressions that are overly complicated and difficult to read.\n",
    "* Move complex expressions into helper functions, especially if you need to use the same logic repeatedly.  \n",
    "* The if/else expression provides a more readable alternative to using Boolean operators like or and and in expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Item \\#5 Know How to Slice Sequences\n",
    "Slicing is typically done with the built-in types `list`, `str`, and `bytes`. However, Slicing can be extended to any Python class that implements the __`getitem`__ and __`setitem`__ special methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "When used in assignments, slices will replace the specified range in the original list. Unlike tuple assignments (like a, b = c[:2]), the length of slice assignments don’t need to be the same. The values before and after the assigned slice will be preserved. The list will grow or shrink to accommodate the new values.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Before ', a)\n",
    "a[2:7] = [99, 22, 14]\n",
    "print('After  ', a)\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "Before  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']\n",
    "After   ['a', 'b', 99, 22, 14, 'h']\n",
